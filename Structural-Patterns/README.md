# Structural atterns

## Introduction

Structural patterns are concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures. Structural class patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces or implementations. Structural object patterns describe ways to compose objects to realize new functionality. The added flexibility of object composition comes at a price: increased complexity. Structural patterns are often easier to understand and use in simple cases, but their structure can become overly complicated in situations where a system must be broken apart into multiple layers. These patterns are more concerned with the composition of classes or objects.
