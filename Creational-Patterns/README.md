# Creational Patterns

## Introduction

Creational patterns are concerned with the way of creating objects. These patterns are used when a decision must be made at the time of instantiation of a class (i.e. creating an object of a class). The creation of an object may lead to a complex process and may require the involvement of other objects as well. Creational patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
